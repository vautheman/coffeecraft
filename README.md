<p>Welcome to CoffeeCraft, a mod offering a variety of coffee-making tools and blocks. Become the barista of your dreams! 
Explore coffee plants, create your own crops and transform your seeds into delicious coffee.</p>

<p>We're two French friends with a passion for Minecraft and modding. We set ourselves the challenge of creating our very first mod. It's the fruit of many hours of research, exchanging ideas and hard work. We're proud of the result and hope you like it.</p>
